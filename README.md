# Marketstack-API-Stock-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

The project involves utilizing the Marketstack API to fetch stock market data and generate insights through visualization. The process includes:

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - **API Integration:** Use the Marketstack API to obtain real-time, intraday, and historical stock market data for selected stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL).
   - **API Request:** Make HTTP GET requests to the Marketstack API with the required parameters, including an API key and stock symbols.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - **Code Execution:** Implement Python for data fetching and JSON handling. Extract data from the API response and process it using Apache Spark.
   - **Spark Integration:** Initialize a Spark session and convert the JSON data into a Spark DataFrame for further analysis.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - **Data Analysis:** Use Spark to analyze the stock market data, including end-of-day prices and trends.
   - **Visualization:** Create visual insights to highlight market trends, stock performance, and other relevant metrics.
   - **Insights Generation:** Provide actionable insights based on the visualized data to support informed investment decisions.

The project enhances financial analysis by integrating comprehensive stock market data with advanced processing and visualization techniques, enabling deeper insights into market trends and stock performance.
